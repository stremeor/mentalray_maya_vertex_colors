# Maya script to generate custom vertex data programmatically.

## maya_create_poly_sphere_with_vertex_colors.py

Creates a poly sphere and assigns two custom vertex colors sets.
1. with the "shared" vertex normal, and
2. with the face normal set on all face-vertices.

In Maya's model view, the colors sets will be displayed like
1. "smooth" normals
2. faceted normals
